When it comes to culinary destinations that still surprise you, Budapest belongs at the very top of the conversation. This is a city shaped by Magyar herdsmen, Ottoman spice traders, Habsburg confectioners, and Jewish grandmothers and every single one of them left something irreplaceable on the table.

The result is a cuisine that is bold, paprika-forward, and defiantly itself. Budapest never chased trends. It perfected what it already had. And what it has  from crimson-hued goulash ladled out of cast-iron pots to architectural feats of sponge cake and caramel  is extraordinary.

We spent four weeks eating our way through the city. From the neighborhood étkezdes of Józsefváros to the ruin bar food stalls of the Jewish Quarter, from market hall lángos vendors to century-old pastry shops in the Castle District  we tasted more than 50 dishes across 30+ restaurants, bakeries, and street stalls. Our goal: to build the definitive guide to the best food in Budapest, backed by structured evaluation and real on-the-ground experience.

## 🔬 How We Evaluated

To build this guide, we tasted each dish at a minimum of three different locations across Budapest  from tourist-facing spots around Váci Street to neighborhood institutions in Józsefváros, Óbuda, and the Castle District.

Every dish was scored using a 100-point evaluation system across six core categories:

- **Flavor Complexity** (25%)  Depth, balance, and layering of taste
- **Ingredient Quality** (20%)  Freshness, sourcing, and authenticity
- **Cultural Significance** (15%)  Historical roots and local importance
- **Accessibility** (15%)  How easy it is to find a great version
- **Value for Money** (15%)  Portion quality relative to cost
- **Overall Experience** (10%)  The total sensory and emotional impact

We evaluated dishes in their most traditional preparations, at locations ranging from Michelin-recognized establishments to no-frills lunch counters that have been feeding the city since before the fall of the Iron Curtain.

## 🥇 Gulyás (Goulash Soup)  Best Overall Dish in Budapest

**Total Score: 95.8 / 100**

There is no separating Budapest from its goulash. Full stop. What the rest of the world calls a stew is, in Hungary, an unambiguous soup  a crimson, paprika-laced broth stacked with tender cubes of beef, potatoes, a scattering of small pasta, and a warmth that goes bone-deep. It is Hungary's national dish, its liquid identity, and the single most important thing you will eat in this city.

The name comes from *gulyás*  the Hungarian cattle herdsmen of the Great Plain who first cooked this dish in heavy cast-iron pots called *bogrács* over open fires. Paprika came later, in the 18th century, and transformed the recipe into something that made Hungarian aristocrats proud enough to use it as a cultural flag against Habsburg centralization. When a dish has that kind of backstory, you know it earned its place.

What separates a great goulash from a forgettable one is time. The best versions are slow-cooked, with beef that surrenders completely to the broth, paprika that blooms rather than burns, and a depth of flavor that takes hours to build. Alongside comes a small dish of fierier hot paprika paste  add it at your own peril, or your own delight.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** Sweet paprika, tender beef, and a broth that builds in heat and savoriness with every spoonful  deceptively simple, endlessly rewarding
- **Ingredient Quality:** The finest versions use Hungarian grey cattle beef and freshly ground paprika. The difference from supermarket paprika is immediate and shocking
- **Cultural Significance:** Hungary's national dish, tied to the origin story of the country's identity. Served at weddings, family gatherings, and every Tuesday at every étkezde in the city
- **Accessibility:** Available at virtually every Hungarian restaurant in Budapest. Prices range from €5 to €10 for a generous bowl
- **Value:** A full meal in itself with a side of crusty bread for under €8 is one of the best deals in Central Europe

**Where We Loved It Most:** Stand25 at the foot of the Buda Castle (Tamás Széll's Bocuse d'Or-winning kitchen elevates this dish without losing its soul), Gettó Gulyás in the Jewish Quarter (cozy, honest, and deeply local), and Café Kör near the Opera House (a handwritten daily menu on the wall, goulash that tastes like a Hungarian grandmother made it).

> **Verdict:** If you eat only one thing in Budapest, this is it. A bowl of properly made goulash in this city will permanently reframe your understanding of what paprika is capable of. Every version we tried  from Michelin-adjacent kitchens to a steamed-up window counter at noon  was worth ordering. This is the dish that built Hungary.

## 🥈 Lángos  Best Street Food Experience

**Total Score: 92.4 / 100**

Lángos is Hungary's greatest gift to anyone eating on foot. A palm-sized round of deep-fried dough  golden, blistered, and crackling at the edges  slathered with sour cream, rubbed with raw garlic, and blanketed in grated cheese. It is street food at its most honest and its most glorious.

The origin is ancient. Lángos (*lángálló*, meaning "fireside") was historically a byproduct of bread baking: a small piece of dough placed near the wood-fired oven's embers to test the temperature. Once pulled out, it was rubbed with pork fat and eaten warm by the family. By the turn of the 20th century, deep-frying replaced ember-baking, and lángos became the cornerstone of Hungarian market culture. Today, the smell of hot oil and frying dough still means one thing in any Budapest market hall: the lángos vendor has a queue.

The classic version  sour cream and cheese  is non-negotiable. But serious lángos spots push further: cooked cabbage, sausage and red onion, Parma ham and arugula, or even a sweet Nutella version for the adventurous. The dough is the star, though. At its best: crispy crust, impossibly soft center, steaming and yielding, barely holding together under the toppings.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** Garlic-scented fried dough with the cool tang of sour cream and the salt of fresh cheese  a contrast that is simultaneously humble and addictive
- **Ingredient Quality:** Potato-leavened dough at the best spots creates extra softness. The quality of the sour cream and the sharpness of the cheese make or break the experience
- **Cultural Significance:** A cornerstone of Hungarian market culture and everyday life, born from bread-baking tradition centuries ago. The Great Market Hall and lángos are inseparable
- **Accessibility:** Sold at market stalls, street windows, and dedicated restaurants across the city. Typically €2–€5 depending on toppings
- **Value:** A full lángos with classic toppings for under €3 is an extraordinary deal  and more than enough for a midday snack

**Where We Loved It Most:** Retró Lángos Budapest near Nyugati Train Station (their dough is exceptional, the toppings generous, and the atmosphere brilliantly no-frills), Ligeti Lángos in the Városliget Pavilon Garden (potato-based dough, exceptional texture), and the upper floor vendors at the Great Market Hall (Nagyvásárcsarnok) on Fővám tér.

> **Verdict:** Lángos is the walk-and-eat essential of Budapest. Eat it hot, straight from the fryer, leaning over the counter to avoid the drips. The sour cream will end up on your chin. This is not a problem. This is the point.

## 🥉 Chicken Paprikash with Nokedli  Best Slow-Cooked Dish

**Total Score: 91.3 / 100**

If goulash is Hungary's national soup, chicken paprikash (*paprikás csirke*) is its national stew  and the dish that most completely encapsulates what Hungarian cuisine does better than anywhere else on earth. Bone-in chicken pieces cooked low and slow in a sauce of onions, sweet Hungarian paprika, and a generous pour of sour cream (*tejföl*). The sauce turns a vibrant, impossible orange. Alongside comes *nokedli*  small, irregular egg dumplings that look like misshapen gnocchi and taste like butter-soaked clouds.

The marriage of creamy paprika sauce and chewy nokedli is one of Central Europe's great flavor pairings. Each component needs the other. The sauce is rich but not heavy; the paprika is sweet before it is hot; the sour cream cools and enriches simultaneously. A properly made paprikash is the culinary equivalent of a warm room on a cold night.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** Sweet paprika, the gentle richness of sour cream, and the deep savory base of slow-cooked chicken create a layered, complex sauce that rewards every bite
- **Ingredient Quality:** The paprika is everything. Hungarian sweet paprika from Kalocsa or Szeged, freshly ground, is what makes the sauce sing. Cheap paprika makes a flat, dusty dish. There is no middle ground
- **Cultural Significance:** A centerpiece of Hungarian family cooking since the 19th century. The dish that Hungarian emigrants missed most, regardless of where in the world they landed
- **Accessibility:** Found at every traditional Hungarian restaurant. A reliable option at both sit-down trattorias and lunch counters. Typically €10–€15
- **Value:** A generous portion of chicken, covered in sauce, with a mountain of nokedli, for under €12 is outstanding value in any major European capital

**Where We Loved It Most:** Hungarikum Bisztró near the Váci Street area (authentic recipe, warm hospitality, exactly what the dish should be), Két Szerecsen Bistro near the Opera House (farm chicken, impeccable nokedli, perfect lunch), and Gettó Gulyás in the Jewish Quarter (the paprikash here is as good as the goulash).

> **Verdict:** Do not leave Budapest without a plate of chicken paprikash and nokedli. This is comfort food refined to its highest expression  the dish every Hungarian cook learns first, and every visitor remembers last. If the paprika is good, nothing else can go wrong.

## 🍰 Dobos Torte  Best Pastry & Cake Experience

**Total Score: 89.7 / 100**

Hungary's most celebrated cake is an architectural marvel. Five to seven thin sponge layers, separated by rich chocolate buttercream, topped with a sheet of amber hard caramel that shatters like glass when you press a fork through it. The Dobos Torte was created in 1885 by József C. Dobos, a Budapest confectioner who debuted it at the National General Exhibition  and caused such a sensation that Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Sisi were served it at the royal court.

What made the Dobos revolutionary was the caramel top: a preservation technique that extended the cake's shelf life in an era before refrigeration, allowing it to be shipped across the Habsburg Empire. The genius was that the technique also created the most satisfying texture contrast in European confectionery  the sharp crack of caramel giving way to silky cream and yielding sponge.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** The interplay between bittersweet chocolate buttercream, light sponge, and burnt-caramel sweetness is precise, layered, and extraordinary  a cake that earns its century-long reputation
- **Ingredient Quality:** The finest versions use a French-style chocolate buttercream, high-quality cocoa, and a caramel top made to order. The sponge must be paper-thin  thick layers signal cutting corners
- **Cultural Significance:** Created in Budapest, presented to the Austro-Hungarian imperial court, and considered one of Hungary's greatest culinary contributions to the world. A symbol of the city's Golden Age confectionery culture
- **Accessibility:** Available at most traditional cukrászdák (pastry shops) and café-patisseries across the city. Typically €4–€7 per slice
- **Value:** A slice of living culinary history for the price of a coffee is a deal that requires no further justification

**Where We Loved It Most:** Café Gerbeaud on Vörösmarty tér (Budapest's most iconic café, serving the Dobos Torte in a setting of chandeliers and marble  worth every forint of the tourist premium), Ruszwurm Cukrászda in the Castle District (the city's oldest operating pastry shop, since 1827, with a version that tastes like it was made specifically to impress an emperor), and Auguszt Cukrászda on Kossuth Lajos Street (go early  the Dobos sells out by afternoon).

> **Verdict:** A great Dobos Torte is one of Europe's finest dessert experiences. The caramel top alone is worth the trip to the pastry counter. Go to Ruszwurm on a quiet morning, order a slice, and sit with it. Take your time. This is not a cake to rush.

## 🔥 Kürtőskalács (Chimney Cake)  Best Street Food Dessert

**Total Score: 88.2 / 100**

The air in Budapest changes when you get near a kürtőskalács stand. That warm, caramelized-sugar-and-yeast smell  a kind of edible perfume that bypasses reason and goes straight to appetite  is one of the city's defining sensory signatures. The kürtőskalács is a strip of sweet dough wrapped in a helix around a wooden or metal cylinder, then rotated slowly over charcoal or a specialist oven until the outside caramelizes and the inside stays soft, yielding, and slightly bread-like.

It originates in Transylvania  the first documented recipe dates to 1784  and it is claimed passionately by Hungary as part of its culinary heritage. Once a festive treat baked for weddings and celebrations, it is now a year-round street food, available in classic coatings (cinnamon, walnut, vanilla, cocoa) and an ever-expanding lineup of modern variations (Nutella, raspberry, ice-cream-filled cones). The traditional version, eaten warm and fresh off the cylinder, is still the best by an unambiguous margin.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** The caramelized sugar shell gives a satisfying crack and sweetness; the interior is soft and lightly yeasty, with warmth carrying the coating flavor all the way through
- **Ingredient Quality:** Traditional charcoal-baked versions have a smokiness that electric-oven versions simply cannot replicate. Always buy from somewhere that bakes on-site
- **Cultural Significance:** One of the oldest documented Hungarian pastries, tied to Transylvanian heritage and festival culture. A symbol of celebration reimagined as an everyday pleasure
- **Accessibility:** Available at street kiosks, specialist shops, and market stalls throughout the city. Typically €2.50–€8 depending on size and fillings
- **Value:** A generously sized chimney cake for under €4, fresh and warm from the fire, is one of the best budget food experiences in Central Europe

**Where We Loved It Most:** Édes Mackó (Vitéz Kürtős) in the Városliget City Park (the last bastion of genuine charcoal baking in Budapest  the difference is unmistakable), Molnár's Kürtőskalács on Váci Street (open since 1922, eight classic flavors, consistently excellent), and Körösfői on Bartók Béla út (run by a Transylvanian couple, no gimmicks, just perfectly made traditional kürtős at local prices).

> **Verdict:** Always buy from somewhere you can see it being baked. If there's no cylinder rotating over heat when you walk up, keep walking. The real thing  warm, caramelized, crackling on the outside, yielding inside  is one of the great street food experiences in Europe.

## 🐟 Halászlé (Fisherman's Soup)  Best Seasonal Dish

**Total Score: 86.9 / 100**

Hungary is a landlocked country, but the Danube and the Tisza rivers have always yielded their riches to the kitchen. Halászlé is the result: a fierce, deeply red fish soup built on freshwater carp or catfish, cooked with enormous quantities of hot paprika, onions, and tomatoes. The broth is fiery and almost opaque with paprika. The fish is falling-apart tender. A thick slice of crusty white bread on the side is not optional  it is structural.

There are two great regional traditions: the Bajai style (cooked with pasta in the pot) and the Szegedi style (pure, no pasta, more intensely reduced). Both are authentic, both are excellent, and the debate between their partisans is the kind that sustains a nation. In Budapest, you'll find both, along with variations featuring fish dumplings, sour cream, and lemon  each village along the river claiming their version is the correct one.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** The heat of the paprika builds slowly and deeply, the fish adds sweetness and body, and the broth has a savory, slightly smoky depth that is genuinely unlike any other fish soup on the continent
- **Ingredient Quality:** Freshwater carp or catfish is essential  substitute sea fish and the dish loses its entire logic. The paprika, as always in Hungarian cooking, must be the real thing
- **Cultural Significance:** A dish tied to the river communities of the Hungarian Plain and the fishing culture of the Danube. Traditionally eaten at Christmas and Easter, but deeply embedded year-round
- **Accessibility:** Available at traditional Hungarian restaurants and along the Danube embankment. Less ubiquitous than goulash, which makes finding a great version more rewarding. Typically €8–€14
- **Value:** A filling, fiery bowl of a truly distinctive soup for under €12 is fair value, especially when you consider how rarely you'll encounter a dish this specific anywhere outside Hungary

**Where We Loved It Most:** Halkakas Fish Bistro (specialists in freshwater fish dishes, several halászlé varieties always on the menu), the upper-floor stalls at the Great Market Hall (Nagyvásárcsarnok), and along the Danube embankment restaurants where the river is visible and the context feels exactly right.

> **Verdict:** Halászlé is not a soup for the timid. It is hot, deep, and aggressively paprika-forward in a way that demands your full attention. Order it in winter. Dip the bread. Work through it slowly. This is one of the most characterful dishes in Central European cooking.

## 🥘 Töltött Káposzta (Stuffed Cabbage)  Best Comfort Dish

**Total Score: 85.4 / 100**

Every great food culture has a dish that functions simultaneously as nourishment, ritual, and memory  and in Hungary, töltött káposzta is that dish. Cabbage leaves filled with a mixture of minced pork, rice, onions, garlic, and paprika, then slow-cooked in a tomato-sour cream sauce alongside smoked pork ribs. The cabbage softens until it almost dissolves around the filling. The sauce concentrates into something dark, tangy, and deeply savory. The whole thing is served with a generous spoonful of cold sour cream melting across the top.

This is weekend food. This is the dish that fills Hungarian grandmothers' kitchens on a Sunday morning, that signals a gathering, that carries the smell of an entire childhood. Visitors who try it for the first time invariably pause mid-bite, because the flavor is simultaneously familiar in structure  meat, grain, vegetable, acid  and entirely new in execution.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** Smoked pork, sweet paprika, tangy tomato, and the cooling shock of sour cream  the flavors build in layers that reward slow eating and second helpings
- **Ingredient Quality:** The smoked pork ribs cooked alongside the rolls are what elevate the sauce from good to remarkable. Sour cabbage (fermented, not fresh) adds an extra fermented depth at the best restaurants
- **Cultural Significance:** A dish that crosses Central and Eastern European borders but claims particular emotional significance in Hungary. Traditionally said to bring health and wealth to whoever eats it  reason enough to order it twice
- **Accessibility:** Available at traditional étkezdes and Hungarian restaurants across the city, particularly on winter menus. Typically €8–€13
- **Value:** A large portion of stuffed cabbage with soup-like sauce and bread represents extraordinary value  a full meal that will carry you through an afternoon of sightseeing

**Where We Loved It Most:** Menza on Liszt Ferenc tér (their version is textbook perfect with a modern edge), the legendary Lecso Restaurant on Szent István krt (where the dish gets the reverence it deserves), and any of the traditional étkezdes in the outer districts where the Tuesday special is always töltött káposzta.

> **Verdict:** Order this on a cold day, in a room full of locals, with a glass of Egri Bikavér red wine. It will feel like someone planned the meal specifically around your comfort. That is not a coincidence. This dish was designed exactly for that purpose.

## 🍮 Somlói Galuska  Best Dessert Experience

**Total Score: 84.1 / 100**

If the Dobos Torte is Budapest's most elegant dessert, the somlói galuska is its most indulgent. A Hungarian trifle  three types of sponge cake (plain, walnut, and chocolate), torn into irregular pieces, soaked in rum syrup and layered with thick vanilla custard, walnut cream, and raisins plumped in Tokaji sweet wine, then topped with a dark chocolate sauce and a cloud of fresh whipped cream. It is glorious excess, built from restraint and technique.

The dish was invented at Budapest's legendary Gundel restaurant in 1958 by József Vajda, a pastry chef who won gold with it at the Brussels World's Fair. It has since become a fixture of every serious Hungarian cukrászda and restaurant  though the quality varies enormously. The somlói demands freshness: stale sponge and pre-made custard reduce it to something ordinary. Made well, it is one of the great dessert experiences on the continent.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

- **Flavor Complexity:** Rum, Tokaji wine, dark chocolate, vanilla, and walnut in a single spoonful  each element present but none overwhelming, in a balance that takes skill to achieve
- **Ingredient Quality:** Freshly made custard and sponge, real rum, and Tokaji-soaked raisins are the markers of quality. The chocolate sauce should be bitter enough to cut the sweetness
- **Cultural Significance:** Invented in Budapest, medaled at the Brussels World's Fair, and now considered one of Hungary's defining confectionery achievements  a dessert that puts the city's pastry culture on the global map
- **Accessibility:** Available at Café Gerbeaud, the better cukrászdák, and traditional Hungarian restaurants. Typically €5–€8
- **Value:** A dessert with this much technical complexity and flavor depth for under €8 is exceptional value by any European standard

**Where We Loved It Most:** Café Gerbeaud on Vörösmarty tér (the raisins are soaked in house Tokaji  the rum fragrance alone is worth the visit), Gundel Restaurant in the City Park (the birthplace of the dish, still making it to the original specification), and Menza on Liszt Ferenc tér (excellent execution, generous portion).

> **Verdict:** The somlói galuska should be shared between two people who both want their own. It is that kind of dessert. Order it at a proper cukrászda, not a tourist café, and make sure it comes with fresh whipped cream. The difference between a mediocre and a great somlói is the difference between a memory and an experience.

## 🧠 Final Verdict: What Should You Eat in Budapest?

Every dish on this list earned its place through weeks of on-the-ground tasting. But your priorities and appetite will determine where to start. Here is our scenario-based breakdown:

### First time in Budapest?
**Start with Gulyás.** Head to Gettó Gulyás in the Jewish Quarter or Stand25 at the foot of Buda Castle. A properly made bowl of goulash is the single most important food experience in the city  and the one that will reframe everything else you eat here.

### On foot and hungry?
**Grab a Lángos.** The vendors on the upper floor of the Great Market Hall are a short walk from the Danube and serve some of the best versions in the city. Eat it hot, over the counter, with sour cream and cheese. Then walk it off along the embankment.

### Sitting down for a proper lunch?
**Order Chicken Paprikash with Nokedli.** This is the quintessential Hungarian sit-down meal. Hungarikum Bisztró and Két Szerecsen both do it impeccably, and neither will empty your wallet.

### Afternoon cake break?
**Go to Ruszwurm for the Dobos Torte.** The Castle District pastry shop has been open since 1827. Arrive mid-morning to avoid the queue and eat in. It is the best possible way to spend forty-five minutes in Budapest.

### Walking the city and craving something sweet?
**Find a real Kürtőskalács stand.** Look for somewhere where you can see the dough rotating over heat. If they're just reheating pre-made cakes, keep walking. The warm, freshly caramelized version is in a different category entirely.

### Cold evening, want something memorable?
**Track down Halászlé or Töltött Káposzta.** Both are best in winter. Both will warm you from the inside out in a way that no other dish in Central Europe quite manages. The Somlói Galuska at Gerbeaud makes the perfect ending.

No matter what you choose, every dish on this list represents Budapest's food culture at its most authentic. This is a city that builds on tradition rather than abandoning it  and those traditions, as we discovered firsthand, are more than worth the trip.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Food in Budapest

### 1. What is the single best food to eat in Budapest?
Gulyás  Hungarian goulash soup  is the definitive Budapest food experience. Scored 95.8/100 in our evaluation, it is the city's most iconic dish, the one most deeply tied to Hungarian identity, and the one that most rewards eating in context. Every visitor should try it at a traditional restaurant.

### 2. Is Hungarian food spicy?
Hungarian food is paprika-forward but not overwhelmingly hot. The most common variety used is sweet paprika, which adds depth and color rather than heat. Most restaurants serve a small dish of hot paprika paste on the side so you can adjust to your own tolerance. Halászlé is the most reliably fiery dish on this list.

### 3. How much does a meal cost in Budapest?
Budapest is one of the most affordable food cities in Western Europe. A bowl of goulash costs €5–€10, a full chicken paprikash with nokedli runs €10–€15, street food like lángos and kürtőskalács are €2–€5, and pastries are typically €3–€7. A full day of excellent eating can cost as little as €25–€35.

### 4. What is the difference between gulyás and pörkölt?
In Hungary, gulyás refers specifically to the soup version  a broth-based preparation with beef, potatoes, and small pasta. Pörkölt is the thicker, soupless stew that the rest of the world often calls "goulash." Both are paprika-based, both are excellent, but they are distinct dishes. When you order gulyás in Budapest, you will receive a soup.

### 5. Where is the best goulash in Budapest?
Stand25 at the foot of Buda Castle (chef Tamás Széll's award-winning kitchen), Gettó Gulyás in the Jewish Quarter (deeply local, no-frills, outstanding), and Café Kör near the Opera House (a handwritten daily menu, reliable since 1995) are the three spots we return to without hesitation.

### 6. What time do Hungarians eat lunch and dinner?
Lunch is the main meal of the day in Hungary, typically served between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM. Many traditional étkezdes are lunch-only, closing by 3:00 PM. Dinner runs from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM at most restaurants. Arriving at 12:30 PM or 7:30 PM puts you in good company with the locals.

### 7. What is a lángos and where can I find the best one?
Lángos is a deep-fried flatbread topped with sour cream, garlic, and cheese  Hungary's most beloved street food. The best versions in Budapest are at Retró Lángos Budapest (near Nyugati Station), the Great Market Hall (upper floor stalls), and Ligeti Lángos in the Városliget park. Always eat it immediately from the fryer.

### 8. What is the Dobos Torte and why is it important?
The Dobos Torte is a multi-layer sponge cake with chocolate buttercream and a hard caramel top, invented by Budapest confectioner József C. Dobos in 1885. It was served to Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Sisi at the Habsburg court and became one of Hungary's most celebrated culinary achievements. Ruszwurm Cukrászda (since 1827) and Café Gerbeaud are the top addresses in Budapest.

### 9. What is kürtőskalács and how do I make sure I'm getting the real thing?
Kürtőskalács (chimney cake) is a Transylvanian-origin pastry made by wrapping sweet dough around a cylinder and roasting it over charcoal until the outside caramelizes and the inside stays soft. The real thing is made on-site, not reheated. Always look for a rotating cylinder over heat before you buy. The best address in Budapest is Édes Mackó (Vitéz Kürtős) in the City Park, which still uses charcoal baking.

### 10. Can I eat well in Budapest on a budget?
Budapest is possibly the best-value food city in Europe for quality-to-price ratio. A lángos for €3, goulash for €6, chicken paprikash for €11, and a Dobos Torte slice for €5  you can eat extraordinarily well for under €30 a day without stepping into a tourist trap. The Great Market Hall, the neighborhood étkezdes, and the traditional cukrászdák offer some of the continent's best value, full stop.
