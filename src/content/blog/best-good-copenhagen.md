When it comes to culinary capitals, Copenhagen stands in a league of its own. This is the city that launched the New Nordic movement, holds 26 Michelin stars across 15 restaurants, and turned foraging, fermentation, and rye bread into a global culinary philosophy — all while staying fiercely rooted in the Danish traditions that define its soul.

From meticulously composed smørrebrød on dense rugbrød to flaky, 27 layer wienerbrød pulled fresh from ovens that have been baking since the 1600s, every dish in Copenhagen tells a story of Viking heritage, Scandinavian resourcefulness, and a relentless drive toward innovation.

We spent over four weeks eating our way through the city — from the historic smørrebrød restaurants of Indre By to the boundary pushing bakeries of Nørrebro and the bustling food halls of Torvehallerne — tasting over 60 dishes across more than 30 restaurants, bakeries, food stalls, and pølsevogne. Our goal: to help you navigate one of the world's greatest food cities and identify the dishes that are absolutely essential when you visit.

## 🔬 How We Evaluated

To build this guide, we tasted each dish at a minimum of three different locations across Copenhagen — from tourist facing spots along Nyhavn to neighborhood gems in Vesterbro, Nørrebro, Østerbro, and Christianshavn.

Every dish was scored using a 100 point evaluation system across six core categories:

* **Flavor Complexity** (25%) — Depth, balance, and layering of taste
* **Ingredient Quality** (20%) — Freshness, sourcing, and authenticity
* **Cultural Significance** (15%) — Historical roots and local importance
* **Accessibility** (15%) — How easy it is to find a great version
* **Value for Money** (15%) — Portion quality relative to cost
* **Overall Experience** (10%) — The total sensory and emotional impact

We evaluated dishes in their most traditional preparations, at locations ranging from Michelin recognized establishments to family run institutions that have been serving the same recipes for generations.

## 🥇 Smørrebrød — Best Overall Dish in Copenhagen

**Total Score: 96.1 / 100**

There is no separating Copenhagen from its smørrebrød. This iconic open faced sandwich — a slice of dense, dark rugbrød (rye bread) spread with butter and piled high with meticulously arranged toppings — is not just the city's signature dish. It is the foundation of Danish lunch culture, a culinary art form with roots stretching back to the 18th century.

What makes smørrebrød in Copenhagen different from anywhere else on earth is the craftsmanship. At the city's best restaurants, each piece is assembled with the precision of a jeweler — layers of pickled herring with onion and capers, roast beef with remoulade and crispy fried onions, or Greenland shrimp pyramided atop a slick of hand whipped mayonnaise and crowned with dill and lemon. These are not sandwiches. They are edible compositions.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The interplay between the dense, malty tang of rugbrød and the toppings — whether briny herring, smoky eel, or sweet shrimp — creates flavor combinations that are deceptively sophisticated
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Top restaurants use house baked rye bread, hand peeled shrimp, house pickled herring, and locally sourced meats. Every component matters
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** An 18th century Danish invention refined over centuries. Restaurant Schønnemann has served smørrebrød since 1877. It is the centerpiece of every Danish julefrokost (Christmas lunch)
* ✓ **Accessibility:** Available at dedicated smørrebrød restaurants, food halls, and bakeries across the city. A single piece typically costs DKK 70 to DKK 140 (€10 to €20)
* ✓ **Value:** Three pieces of world class smørrebrød with a cold Carlsberg or a glass of aquavit for under DKK 400 is an extraordinary Copenhagen lunch

**Where We Loved It Most:** Restaurant Schønnemann (since 1877, dark wood paneling, white linens, tabs chalked on the counter, and the finest traditional smørrebrød in Denmark), Aamanns 1921 (modern interpretations by Adam Aamann, Copenhagen's reigning king of smørrebrød), and Restaurant Palægade (elegant, seasonal compositions that blur the line between sandwich and fine dining).

> **Verdict:** If you eat only one thing in Copenhagen, this is it. A proper Danish smørrebrød lunch — three or four pieces, eaten with knife and fork, paired with ice cold aquavit and a cold pilsner — will permanently change how you think about bread, toppings, and the art of lunch. This is ground zero for the open faced sandwich, and no other city on earth comes close.

## 🥈 Wienerbrød (Danish Pastries) — Best Bakery Experience

**Total Score: 94.3 / 100**

Copenhagen is experiencing a golden age of baking. The city's wienerbrød — what the rest of the world calls "Danish pastries" but Danes call "Vienna bread" in a nod to the Austrian bakers who introduced laminated dough techniques in the 19th century — have been elevated to an art form by a generation of bakers, many of them trained at Noma.

The variety is staggering: kanelsnegle (cinnamon snails with a gooey, spiced center), spandauer (square shaped pastries filled with vanilla custard or jam), tebirkes (poppy seed rolls with marzipan and butter), and cardamom buns that shatter into a thousand buttery layers on first bite. The best versions use 27 folds of laminated dough, organic Danish butter, and hand mixed fillings.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The contrast between shattering, caramelized exterior layers and soft, butter rich interior — combined with fillings ranging from vanilla custard to cardamom and marzipan — is extraordinary
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Top bakeries use organic flour, Danish butter, house made vanilla custard, and seasonal fruits. Hart Bageri, founded by a former Tartine baker, exemplifies this standard
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** Despite Austrian origins, Danes made wienerbrød their own over 150 years. Sankt Peders Bageri has baked since 1652 — Copenhagen's oldest bakery
* ✓ **Accessibility:** World class bakeries in every neighborhood. A pastry typically costs DKK 25 to DKK 55 (€3.50 to €7.50)
* ✓ **Value:** A cardamom bun and a specialty coffee for under DKK 90 is one of the great breakfast experiences in Northern Europe

**Where We Loved It Most:** Hart Bageri (founded by Richard Hart of Tartine and Noma fame, with locations across the city), Juno the Bakery in Østerbro (run by former Noma pastry chef Emil Glaser, legendary cardamom buns), and Sankt Peders Bageri (Copenhagen's oldest bakery, dating to 1652, famous for their Wednesday cinnamon rolls).

> **Verdict:** Copenhagen's bakery scene is arguably the finest in Europe right now. A morning spent hopping between Hart Bageri, Juno, and Bageriet Benji — cardamom bun in one hand, flat white in the other — is one of the great food experiences on the continent. The kanelsnegle alone is worth the flight.

## 🥉 New Nordic Tasting Menu — Best Fine Dining Experience

**Total Score: 92.7 / 100**

In 2004, chef René Redzepi and food entrepreneur Claus Meyer published the New Nordic Kitchen Manifesto, and Copenhagen's culinary trajectory changed forever. The movement — focused on local, seasonal, foraged, and fermented ingredients prepared with technical precision and artistic vision — put Copenhagen on the global food map and spawned a generation of restaurants that continue to push boundaries.

Today, Copenhagen holds 26 Michelin stars across 15 restaurants, including Alchemist (ranked 8th in the World's 50 Best), and the city's influence extends through alumni who have opened bakeries, wine bars, and bistros across every neighborhood.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** Dishes built around fermentation, foraging, smoking, and pickling deliver flavors that are impossible to replicate anywhere else — seaweed, wild herbs, cured egg yolk, and aged vinegars in combinations that challenge and reward
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Ingredients are often foraged from Danish forests, harvested from Nordic coastlines, or sourced from small Danish farms. Seasonality is absolute
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** The New Nordic Manifesto of 2004 is one of the most influential culinary documents of the 21st century. It redefined how the world thinks about Scandinavian food
* ✓ **Accessibility:** Options range from accessible New Nordic bistros (DKK 400 to DKK 800 for a tasting menu) to world class multi course experiences (DKK 2,500+)
* ✓ **Value:** Bistro level New Nordic tasting menus offer extraordinary quality relative to comparable fine dining in London, Paris, or New York

**Where We Loved It Most:** Alchemist (theatrical, 50+ course immersive experience by chef Rasmus Munk), Kadeau (Bornholm inspired, nature driven cuisine), and Høst (accessible, rustic New Nordic in a stunning interior — a perfect entry point for first time visitors).

> **Verdict:** You do not need to spend DKK 3,000 to experience New Nordic cuisine in Copenhagen. Restaurants like Høst and Vækst offer accessible, beautifully executed tasting menus that capture the philosophy without emptying your wallet. But if you have the budget, the world class experiences here are unlike anything else in global gastronomy.

## 🥩 Stegt Flæsk med Persillesovs — Best Traditional Danish Dish

**Total Score: 90.8 / 100**

Stegt flæsk — crispy fried pork belly served with boiled potatoes and a creamy parsley sauce — is Denmark's official national dish, voted into that position by the Danish people themselves in 2014. It is the culinary equivalent of hygge: simple, warming, deeply satisfying, and unapologetically Danish.

The pork belly is sliced thick, then pan fried or oven roasted until the skin crackles and shatters while the meat stays tender and juicy. The parsley sauce (persillesovs) is a creamy, butter based white sauce loaded with fresh parsley. The potatoes are boiled, plain, and perfect. Together, the three components create a dish of surprising harmony.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The salty crunch of the crackling, the richness of the pork fat, the herbaceous freshness of the parsley sauce, and the starchy comfort of the potatoes create a four way balance that is deeply satisfying
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Danish pork is world renowned for its quality. The best versions use thick cut belly from free range Danish pigs, fresh parsley, and real butter in the sauce
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** Voted Denmark's national dish in 2014. Origins trace to rural Danish farmhouse cooking of the 1700s. A staple of Sunday dinners and holiday gatherings
* ✓ **Accessibility:** Available at traditional Danish restaurants across the city. Typically DKK 150 to DKK 220 (€20 to €30). Some restaurants offer all you can eat versions
* ✓ **Value:** A generous plate of the national dish with potatoes and sauce for under DKK 200 is a hearty, filling, and culturally significant meal

**Where We Loved It Most:** Restaurant Vita on Store Kongensgade (a historic institution with classic Danish cooking), Klubben (red checkered tablecloths, big portions, no pretense), and Nyboders Køkken (an old school gem offering all you can eat stegt flæsk).

> **Verdict:** You cannot claim to have eaten in Denmark without trying stegt flæsk. It is not sophisticated. It is not Instagram worthy. It is the honest, salty, crispy, creamy soul of Danish home cooking on a plate — and after one bite, you will understand exactly why the Danes voted it their national dish.

## 🥟 Frikadeller — Best Comfort Food

**Total Score: 89.4 / 100**

Frikadeller — Danish pan fried meatballs made from a mix of pork and sometimes veal, seasoned with onion, egg, milk soaked bread, and a whisper of allspice — are the dish that every Dane grew up eating. Flatter and wider than Italian or Swedish meatballs, they are pan fried in butter until golden brown with a slightly caramelized crust.

The origins trace to at least the 17th century, with the name likely derived from the Italian "frittatella" (small fried thing), suggesting Mediterranean influence via German or Dutch trade routes. By the 18th century, frikadeller had become a recorded staple of Danish cookbooks.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The caramelized, butter crisped exterior gives way to a soft, juicy, mildly seasoned interior. Served with boiled potatoes, brown gravy, and sweet sour red cabbage — a complete flavor spectrum
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Traditional versions use a blend of pork and veal, fresh onion, and milk soaked bread for moisture. Quality butter for frying is essential
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** One of Denmark's oldest continuously prepared dishes, with recipes recorded since the 1700s. A cornerstone of Danish family dinners
* ✓ **Accessibility:** Found at traditional restaurants, lunch spots, and food halls across Copenhagen. Typically DKK 120 to DKK 180
* ✓ **Value:** A plate of homemade frikadeller with all the traditional accompaniments for under DKK 160 is excellent value for authentic Danish comfort food

**Where We Loved It Most:** Københavner Caféen (a cozy, authentic spot tucked in a narrow street, with a smørrebrød heavy lunch menu and superb frikadeller), Restaurant Vita (where the meatballs arrive alongside a full spread of traditional sides), and Nyhavns Færgekro (a 17th century ferry inn with harbor views and solid traditional fare).

> **Verdict:** Frikadeller are the dish that separates tourists from travelers. Order them at a proper Danish restaurant — not a tourist trap on Nyhavn — and you will taste the honest, butter browned heart of Danish home cooking. The red cabbage on the side is not optional.

## 🌭 Røde Pølser — Best Street Food

**Total Score: 88.2 / 100**

The røde pølser — Denmark's iconic bright red hot dog — has been a Copenhagen street food institution since the first pølsevogn (hot dog cart) appeared in the 1920s. Over 120 mobile pølsevogne operate across Copenhagen year round, serving these distinctively colored pure pork sausages in soft buns with a lineup of condiments that is uniquely Danish.

The classic preparation includes the red sausage in a bun, topped with ketchup, Danish remoulade (a sweet, pickle studded mustard sauce), raw chopped onions, crispy fried onions, and sliced pickles. It is messy, flavorful, and unmistakably Copenhagen.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The snappy casing of the pølser, the tangy sweetness of remoulade, the crunch of fried onions, and the sharpness of raw onion and pickles create a layered street food experience
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Traditional pølser are made from pure pork. DØP, at the foot of the Round Tower, uses certified organic sausages
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** First appeared in the 1920s and quickly became an icon of Danish street culture. The pølsevogn is as much a part of Copenhagen's identity as its bicycles
* ✓ **Accessibility:** Available at over 120 street carts across the city, open year round. Typically DKK 35 to DKK 55 (€5 to €7.50)
* ✓ **Value:** A complete hot dog with all the fixings for under DKK 50 is one of the best cheap eats in Scandinavia

**Where We Loved It Most:** DØP Pølser (organic hot dogs at the base of the Round Tower), John's Hotdog Deli in the Meatpacking District (gourmet takes on the classic), and the classic pølsevogn carts scattered across the city — look for the ones with queues of locals.

> **Verdict:** Do not leave Copenhagen without eating a røde pølser from a street cart. Load it with remoulade, fried onions, and pickles. Eat it standing on a sidewalk with a cold Carlsberg in your other hand. This is Copenhagen street food at its most iconic, and it costs less than a fancy coffee.

## 🐟 Pickled Herring — Best Seafood Dish

**Total Score: 87.6 / 100**

Denmark's relationship with herring stretches back over a thousand years to the Vikings, and pickled herring remains a cornerstone of Danish cuisine. In Copenhagen, it appears everywhere — as a smørrebrød topping, as the opening course of a traditional julefrokost, and as a standalone tapa at wine bars and restaurants across the city.

The varieties are extraordinary: marineret sild (marinated in vinegar with onion and capers), karry sild (curried herring, a beloved Danish invention), kryddersild (spiced with allspice, cinnamon, and cloves), and stegt sild (breaded and pan fried). Each tells a different story of preservation, seasonality, and culinary ingenuity.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The vinegar brine, the sweetness of the curing liquid, the pungency of onion, and the delicate fish create layers of flavor that evolve with each bite. Curried herring adds a warm, spiced dimension unique to Denmark
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Top restaurants cure their own herring in house, using traditional techniques passed down through generations. Restaurant Schønnemann is famous for its long matured herring
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** A Viking era tradition with over 1,000 years of history. An essential component of smørrebrød and the mandatory first course at every Danish julefrokost
* ✓ **Accessibility:** Available at smørrebrød restaurants, food halls, and traditional eateries across the city. DKK 60 to DKK 120 as a smørrebrød piece
* ✓ **Value:** A plate of house pickled herring with rugbrød for under DKK 100 is an affordable gateway into a millennium of Danish food culture

**Where We Loved It Most:** Restaurant Schønnemann (long matured herring paired with chilled aquavit — the definitive pairing), Told & Snaps (a full herring menu with house distilled snaps), and Restaurant Kronborg (outstanding herring platters in a relaxed, central setting).

> **Verdict:** If smørrebrød is Copenhagen's greatest dish, pickled herring is its greatest ingredient. Order the herring platter at Schønnemann — three styles of herring, a shot of ice cold aquavit, and a piece of rugbrød — and you will taste a thousand years of Danish culinary history in a single sitting.

## ☕ Specialty Coffee — Best Drink Experience

**Total Score: 86.5 / 100**

Copenhagen is one of the world's great coffee cities. Anchored by roasters like Coffee Collective (founded in 2007, pioneers of Scandinavian specialty coffee), the city has developed a café culture that rivals Melbourne and Tokyo for quality, consistency, and innovation.

The style is distinctly Nordic: light roasts that highlight the origin character of the beans, precise extraction, and an emphasis on traceability and sustainability. Pair a flat white or a pour over with a cardamom bun from the bakery next door, and you have the quintessential Copenhagen morning ritual.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

* ✓ **Flavor Complexity:** Nordic light roasts deliver bright, fruity, and floral notes that contrast sharply with the darker, more bitter roasts common in Southern Europe. The flavor clarity is exceptional
* ✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Copenhagen's top roasters source directly from farms, with full traceability from bean to cup. Coffee Collective was among the first in Europe to adopt this model
* ✓ **Cultural Significance:** Copenhagen helped pioneer the Scandinavian specialty coffee movement. The city's café culture is deeply intertwined with hygge and the Danish way of life
* ✓ **Accessibility:** World class coffee shops in every neighborhood. A specialty coffee typically costs DKK 40 to DKK 60 (€5.50 to €8.50)
* ✓ **Value:** Among the world's finest specialty coffee for under DKK 55 — comparable to Melbourne or Tokyo but at similar or lower prices

**Where We Loved It Most:** Coffee Collective (multiple locations, the city's flagship specialty roaster), Prolog Coffee Bar (a cozy Vesterbro gem), and Democratic Coffee (a central spot near Strøget with excellent pour overs).

> **Verdict:** Do not drink bad coffee in Copenhagen. The city has made it nearly impossible to do so, but you should still seek out the specialists. A Coffee Collective flat white paired with a Hart Bageri cardamom bun is the Copenhagen morning ritual — and one of the finest breakfast combinations in Europe.

## 🧠 Final Verdict: What Should You Eat in Copenhagen?

Every dish on this list earned its spot through weeks of dedicated tasting across the city. But your priorities and appetite will determine what you chase first. Here is our scenario based breakdown:

**First time in Copenhagen?** → **Smørrebrød at Restaurant Schønnemann.** Three pieces of meticulously composed open faced sandwich, a shot of aquavit, and a cold pilsner in a room that has been serving Danish lunch since 1877. This is the single most important food experience in the city.

**Morning ritual?** → **Wienerbrød and specialty coffee.** Start at Hart Bageri for a cardamom bun, then walk to Coffee Collective for a flat white. Or head to Juno the Bakery in Østerbro for both under one roof. This is how Copenhagen wakes up.

**Want the full Danish experience?** → **Stegt Flæsk at Restaurant Vita.** The national dish — crispy pork belly, creamy parsley sauce, and boiled potatoes — served in a historic setting that feels like stepping into a Danish painting.

**Walking and exploring?** → **Røde Pølser from a street cart.** Find a pølsevogn with a queue, order the classic with remoulade and fried onions, and eat it while strolling past the colorful houses of Nyhavn. Under DKK 50 and unforgettable.

**Special occasion?** → **New Nordic Tasting Menu at Kadeau or Alchemist.** Copenhagen's Michelin starred restaurants offer experiences that exist nowhere else on earth. For a more accessible entry, try Høst or Vækst.

**Rainy afternoon in need of comfort?** → **Frikadeller at Københavner Caféen.** Butter browned meatballs, boiled potatoes, brown gravy, and red cabbage in a cozy, candlelit room. This is hygge on a plate.

No matter what you choose, every dish on this list represents Danish food culture at its most authentic. Copenhagen is not a city that chases trends — it sets them. And behind the Michelin stars and the New Nordic revolution, the honest traditions of smørrebrød, stegt flæsk, and a røde pølser on a cold afternoon remain the beating heart of the city's food scene.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Food in Copenhagen

**1. What is the single best food to eat in Copenhagen?**

Smørrebrød is the definitive Copenhagen food experience. Scored 96.1/100 in our evaluation, it is Denmark's most iconic dish and the foundation of Danish lunch culture. Every visitor should try a proper smørrebrød lunch at a traditional restaurant like Schønnemann or Aamanns 1921.

**2. Is Copenhagen expensive for food?**

Copenhagen is not cheap, but it offers excellent value at every price point. A røde pølser from a street cart costs DKK 35 to 55, a pastry and coffee costs DKK 65 to 90, a smørrebrød lunch runs DKK 250 to 400, and a casual dinner is DKK 200 to 350. A full day of excellent eating can be done for DKK 400 to 600 (€55 to €85) if you mix street food, bakeries, and casual restaurants.

**3. What is smørrebrød and how do you eat it?**

Smørrebrød is an open faced sandwich built on a slice of dense Danish rye bread (rugbrød), spread with butter, and topped with combinations like pickled herring, roast beef with remoulade, or shrimp with mayonnaise and dill. It is always eaten with a knife and fork — never picked up. Traditionally paired with cold pilsner and ice cold aquavit.

**4. What is the New Nordic cuisine movement?**

New Nordic cuisine was formally established in 2004 when chef René Redzepi and food entrepreneur Claus Meyer published the New Nordic Kitchen Manifesto. The movement focuses on local, seasonal, foraged, and fermented ingredients, traditional preservation techniques, and a commitment to sustainability. It put Copenhagen on the world's fine dining map.

**5. Where are the best bakeries in Copenhagen?**

Hart Bageri (multiple locations, founded by former Tartine baker Richard Hart) is the most celebrated. Juno the Bakery in Østerbro (run by Noma alumnus Emil Glaser) is legendary for cardamom buns. Bageriet Benji in Nørrebro (founded by Noma's former head baker) excels at spandauer. Sankt Peders Bageri (dating to 1652) serves the city's most famous cinnamon rolls.

**6. What is stegt flæsk and why is it the national dish?**

Stegt flæsk med persillesovs is crispy fried pork belly served with boiled potatoes and a creamy parsley sauce. In 2014, the Danish people voted it Denmark's official national dish. It originates from rural farmhouse cooking in the 1700s and represents the simple, satisfying, pork centered tradition of Danish cuisine.

**7. What time do Danes eat meals?**

Lunch in Copenhagen typically runs from 11:30 AM to 2:00 PM, and dinner service starts around 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Danes eat dinner earlier than Southern Europeans. Many traditional lunch restaurants close by 3:00 PM, and popular dinner spots fill up by 7:00 PM. Reservations are strongly recommended at popular restaurants, especially on weekends.

**8. What should I drink in Copenhagen?**

Aquavit (a caraway or dill infused spirit served ice cold) is the traditional pairing for smørrebrød and herring. Carlsberg pilsner is the local draft beer, though Copenhagen's craft beer scene is excellent (try Mikkeller or To Øl). Specialty coffee is world class. Natural wine bars have exploded in popularity across Vesterbro and Nørrebro.

**9. What are the best food markets in Copenhagen?**

Torvehallerne (two glass halls near Nørreport Station) is the city's premier food market, with vendors selling smørrebrød, fresh seafood, Danish cheese, pastries, and specialty goods. Reffen (open March through October) is a waterfront street food market with global cuisines. The Meatpacking District (Kødbyen) in Vesterbro houses some of the city's most vibrant restaurants and bars.

**10. Can I eat well in Copenhagen on a budget?**

Yes. A pastry and coffee for DKK 70, a røde pølser for DKK 45, smørrebrød from a food hall for DKK 80, and a casual dinner plate for DKK 150 — you can eat extraordinarily well for under DKK 500 (roughly €70) per day. The key is to lean into bakeries, street food, food halls, and lunch focused restaurants rather than dinner service at sit down establishments.
