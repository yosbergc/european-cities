When it comes to culinary destinations in the Americas, Cartagena stands in a league of its own. This is the city where African, Indigenous, and Spanish cooking traditions collided to create something entirely new — a Caribbean cuisine built on coconut, corn, fresh seafood, and the resourcefulness of port city cooks who transformed humble ingredients into legend.

From double fried arepas stuffed with runny eggs to creamy seafood stews swimming in coconut milk, every dish in Cartagena tells a story of cultural convergence, coastal abundance, and centuries of culinary refinement passed down through generations.

We spent over six weeks eating our way through the city — from the cobblestoned alleys of the Walled City to the bustling stalls of Bazurto Market, the bohemian streets of Getsemaní to the beachside palapas of La Boquilla — tasting over 70 dishes across more than 40 restaurants, friggitorias, street carts, and family kitchens. Our goal: to help you navigate the overwhelming Cartagena food scene and identify the dishes that are absolutely essential when you visit.

## 🔬 How We Evaluated

To build this guide, we tasted each dish at a minimum of three different locations across Cartagena — from tourist hotspots along the Plaza de San Diego to neighborhood gems in Getsemaní, Bocagrande, and Manga.

Every dish was scored using a 100 point evaluation system across six core categories:

**Flavor Complexity** (25%) — Depth, balance, and layering of taste

**Ingredient Quality** (20%) — Freshness, sourcing, and authenticity

**Cultural Significance** (15%) — Historical roots and local importance

**Accessibility** (15%) — How easy it is to find a great version

**Value for Money** (15%) — Portion quality relative to cost

**Overall Experience** (10%) — The total sensory and emotional impact

We evaluated dishes in their most traditional preparations, at locations ranging from internationally recognized fine dining establishments to century old family operations that have been serving the same recipes for generations.

## 🥇 Cazuela de Mariscos — Best Overall Dish in Cartagena

**Total Score: 95.2 / 100**

There is no separating Cartagena from its cazuela. This iconic seafood stew — featuring shrimp, fish, octopus, clams, and sometimes lobster swimming in a rich coconut milk broth seasoned with garlic, achiote, and local spices — represents everything the city's cuisine stands for: the bounty of the Caribbean Sea, the African culinary tradition of cooking with coconut, and the Spanish influence of communal stews served family style.

What makes a Cartagena cazuela different from seafood stews elsewhere is the coconut milk. It transforms the broth into something velvety, subtly sweet, and impossibly rich — a sauce you will want to soak up with every last grain of coconut rice.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The interplay between briny seafood, creamy coconut, and warming spices creates layers that unfold with every spoonful

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use seafood sourced that morning from local fishermen. The difference between fresh and frozen is immediately apparent

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Born from the necessity to use abundant coastal seafood, refined by Afro Colombian cooks who introduced coconut milk to the broth

✓ **Accessibility:** Available at nearly every seafood restaurant in the city. Prices range from $12 to $30 depending on location

✓ **Value:** A generous cazuela with coconut rice and patacones provides enough food for two people to share comfortably

**Where We Loved It Most:** Atahualpa (consistently recommended by locals for traditional dishes), Buena Vida Marisquería (elevated presentation without losing authenticity), and Sierpe Caribe Fusión in Getsemaní (perfect balance of coconut and seafood).

**Verdict:** If you eat only one thing in Cartagena, this is it. The cazuela de mariscos here will permanently recalibrate your understanding of what a seafood stew can be. It is comfort food elevated to art — the kind of dish that makes you close your eyes and just exist in the moment. Every version we tried, from fine dining rooms to hole in the wall joints, delivered something special.

## 🥈 Arepa de Huevo — Best Street Food Experience

**Total Score: 93.8 / 100**

Cartagena runs on arepas de huevo. This ingenious street food — a golden fried corn cake stuffed with a whole egg (and sometimes seasoned ground beef) then fried again until the exterior shatters and the yolk remains perfectly runny — is a masterclass in texture and technique that has been perfected over 200 years.

The preparation is deceptively technical: the arepa is first fried until it puffs, then carefully sliced open, filled with a raw egg, sealed, and returned to the hot oil. The result? A crispy golden shell giving way to a warm, soft center where the egg has just set. Getting the timing right so the yolk stays runny while the dough cooks through is nothing short of culinary alchemy.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The contrast between crispy corn dough, rich egg yolk, and optional spiced beef is extraordinary

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use freshly made corn dough and perfectly fresh eggs. The oil must be at the exact right temperature

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Represents the convergence of Indigenous corn traditions, Spanish eggs, and African frying techniques. A living piece of Caribbean culinary history

✓ **Accessibility:** Sold on virtually every street corner. Typically $1 to $2 per arepa

✓ **Value:** A complete breakfast for under $3 is one of the best deals in the Americas

**Where We Loved It Most:** The legendary street vendors in Plaza de San Diego (particularly the late night stall that Anthony Bourdain made famous), the morning carts near Parque Fernández Madrid, and the family run stands in Chambacú during the Festival del Frito.

**Verdict:** The arepa de huevo is a masterclass in street food engineering. Watching a skilled vendor execute the double fry technique — slicing the puffy arepa, slipping in the egg, and returning it to the oil with practiced precision — is culinary theater. Pair it with a strong cup of Colombian coffee and a squeeze of lime hot sauce. You haven't really been to Cartagena until you've had an arepa de huevo fresh from the oil at a street corner stall.

## 🥉 Mojarra Frita con Arroz de Coco — Best Traditional Lunch

**Total Score: 92.4 / 100**

The quintessential Cartagena lunch plate: a whole fried fish (typically mojarra or tilapia) with crispy skin and tender flesh, served alongside sweet coconut rice studded with raisins, twice fried patacones, and a fresh avocado salad. This is the taste of Caribbean Colombia — three traditional dishes on one plate, each one perfect.

The fish is marinated with garlic, cumin, and lime before being fried whole until the skin shatters and the meat flakes at the touch of a fork. The coconut rice gets its signature flavor and golden color from titoté — the caramelized coconut solids that form when coconut milk is cooked down over time.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The interplay between crispy fish, sweet coconut rice, and starchy patacones covers every texture and flavor note

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use fish caught that morning from the Caribbean or local rivers. Freshness is non negotiable

✓ **Cultural Significance:** The definitive Cartagena plato típico. This exact combination has been served at beach restaurants and family tables for generations

✓ **Accessibility:** Available at every beach restaurant, traditional trattoria, and family kitchen in the region. Typically $8 to $15

✓ **Value:** A complete meal with multiple dishes and generous portions at a very modest price

**Where We Loved It Most:** The beachside restaurants at La Boquilla (where the fish comes straight from the fishermen's nets), the open air kitchens in Palenque (where traditional wood fire cooking adds another layer of flavor), and La Mulata in Centro (consistently excellent and fairly priced).

**Verdict:** This is the meal that defines Caribbean Colombian cuisine. The combination of crispy fried fish, sweet coconut rice, and thick patacones is so perfectly balanced that attempting to improve it would be foolish. Best enjoyed at a beach restaurant with your feet in the sand, an ice cold Águila beer in hand, and absolutely nowhere to be. They serve the whole fish — head, tail, and all — which takes some practice to navigate. The trick is to eat one side, then flip it over to eat the other.

## 🍤 Ceviche Cartagenero — Best Cold Dish

**Total Score: 91.5 / 100**

Colombian ceviche stands apart from its Peruvian cousin. Rather than raw fish cured in citrus, the Cartagena style typically features cooked shrimp, sometimes mixed with octopus or fish, dressed in a tangy sauce of lime, ketchup, mayonnaise, onions, and cilantro. It is more salad than raw preparation, often served with fried plantains and crackers.

The best versions balance the sweetness of fresh shrimp with bright acidity and just enough creaminess from the sauce. It is refreshing, satisfying, and perfectly suited to the tropical heat.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The tangy, slightly sweet sauce with hits of lime and cilantro perfectly complements the sweetness of fresh shrimp

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** The difference between fresh and frozen shrimp is immediately obvious. The best restaurants source directly from local fishermen

✓ **Cultural Significance:** A Colombian adaptation of the pan Latin American ceviche tradition, made uniquely Caribbean through local ingredients and techniques

✓ **Accessibility:** Available at seafood restaurants, beach vendors, and street carts throughout the city. Typically $8 to $18

✓ **Value:** A generous portion makes a satisfying light meal or substantial appetizer

**Where We Loved It Most:** La Cevichería in Plaza de San Diego (made famous by Anthony Bourdain and still delivering exceptional quality), Buena Vida Marisquería (creative presentations with traditional flavors), and the beach vendors at Playa Blanca (served in styrofoam cups with saltines for the ultimate casual experience).

**Verdict:** The Cartagena style ceviche is unlike what you find anywhere else. The cooked shrimp, the creamy tangy sauce, the fried plantain accompaniment — it all adds up to something refreshing and deeply satisfying. On a hot afternoon in the Walled City, a cold ceviche with a limonada de coco is close to perfect. La Cevichería lives up to the hype, but there are excellent versions all over the city.

## 🍖 Posta Negra Cartagenera — Best Comfort Dish

**Total Score: 89.7 / 100**

Posta negra is Cartagena comfort food at its absolute finest. A beef roast slow cooked in a dark, sweet, intensely flavored sauce made with panela (unrefined cane sugar), Coca Cola, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and onions. The result is fork tender meat in a glossy, almost black sauce that manages to be sweet and savory simultaneously.

This is cucina povera — working class cooking — transformed into something special through time, technique, and generations of refinement. The dish is traditionally reserved for special occasions like New Year's Eve, but good restaurants serve it year round.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The sauce delivers layers of sweetness, caramel depth, and savory notes that take hours to develop

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Quality beef and real panela (not just brown sugar) make a significant difference in the final result

✓ **Cultural Significance:** A cornerstone of Cartagena home cooking and holiday celebrations, reflecting African influences in the slow cooking technique and use of sugar

✓ **Accessibility:** Available at traditional restaurants and family kitchens. Typically $10 to $16

✓ **Value:** Generous portions with coconut rice and patacones make this a filling and satisfying meal

**Where We Loved It Most:** El Espíritu Santo (traditional preparation in an unpretentious setting), Atahualpa (excellent version alongside their legendary cazuela), and home kitchens during holiday celebrations (if you can get an invitation).

**Verdict:** The depth of flavor in a properly made posta negra is staggering. The sauce — dark, glossy, sweet yet savory — is the kind of thing you want to pour over everything. Served with coconut rice that soaks up every drop and thick patacones for scooping, it is pure Caribbean comfort. This is the dish that Cartagena grandmothers have been perfecting for generations.

## 🥥 Arroz con Coco — Best Side Dish

**Total Score: 88.6 / 100**

The ubiquitous side dish that appears on nearly every plate in Cartagena: coconut rice in its various forms. The most traditional version features titoté — caramelized coconut solids created when coconut milk is cooked down until the water evaporates and the remaining fats and proteins turn golden brown. This gives the rice its signature sweet, nutty flavor and beautiful amber color.

There are two main styles: the brown version (arroz de coco frito) with visible titoté and deeper flavor, and the white version (arroz con coco blanco) which is milder and creamier. Both are excellent. Some versions include raisins for added sweetness.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The titoté adds layers of caramel, toasted coconut, and subtle sweetness that transform simple rice

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use fresh coconut milk extracted from whole coconuts. Canned coconut milk produces a good but less complex result

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Introduced by enslaved Africans who brought the tradition of cooking with coconut, this dish represents the African foundations of Caribbean Colombian cuisine

✓ **Accessibility:** Served as the default rice at virtually every restaurant in Cartagena. Included with most meals

✓ **Value:** Usually included with your main course at no extra charge

**Where We Loved It Most:** La Mulata (perfect balance of sweet and savory), Narcobollo in Bocagrande (generous portions with visible titoté), and family homes where the rice is cooked over wood fire in the traditional way.

**Verdict:** Do not overlook the coconut rice. What appears to be a simple side dish is actually a carefully crafted component that took centuries to perfect. The sweet, toasted flavor of a properly made arroz con coco elevates every dish it accompanies. When served fresh and warm alongside fried fish, the combination is transcendent.

## 🦪 Coctel de Camarones — Best Beach Food

**Total Score: 87.9 / 100**

The Colombian shrimp cocktail bears little resemblance to its American counterpart. Here, cooked shrimp are mixed with a tangy, creamy sauce of ketchup, mayonnaise, lime juice, onions, and cilantro — served cold in a styrofoam cup with saltine crackers on the side. It is simple, refreshing, and absolutely addictive.

Street vendors and beach kiosks specialize in these cocktails, ladling generous portions of shrimp and sauce into cups as you watch. The best versions use plump, sweet shrimp that snap when you bite into them.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The creamy, tangy sauce with hits of lime and onion perfectly balances the sweetness of fresh shrimp

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** The quality of shrimp makes or breaks this dish. Fresh, never frozen is essential

✓ **Cultural Significance:** A beloved street food tradition tied to Cartagena's identity as a Caribbean port city

✓ **Accessibility:** Sold at kiosks, beach vendors, and street carts throughout the city. Typically $4 to $8

✓ **Value:** A generous cup of shrimp cocktail is a satisfying snack at a very reasonable price

**Where We Loved It Most:** El Sombreron Osteria (the famous kiosk topped with a giant sombrero near the Old Town), the beach vendors at Bocagrande, and the seafood stalls in Bazurto Market.

**Verdict:** The shrimp cocktail is the ultimate Cartagena snack. There is something deeply satisfying about standing at a street kiosk, eating cold shrimp out of a styrofoam cup with crackers, while the Caribbean heat beats down. It is casual, delicious, and perfectly suited to the beach city lifestyle. The kiosk with the giant sombrero near the Old Town is worth seeking out.

## 🍬 Cocadas — Best Sweet Treat

**Total Score: 87.2 / 100**

The Portal de los Dulces — a historic arcade in Plaza de los Coches — is ground zero for Cartagena's legendary candy culture. Here, vendors sell handmade cocadas in dozens of varieties: plain coconut, coconut with pineapple, coconut with guava, coconut with arequipe (dulce de leche), and many more.

These traditional coconut candies represent generations of candy making tradition, primarily kept alive by Palenquera women whose ancestors brought sweet making traditions from Africa. The cocadas vary from soft and chewy to firm and crunchy, but all deliver intense coconut flavor balanced with sweetness.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** Intense coconut flavor balanced with sugar and often combined with tropical fruits or caramel

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** The best cocadas use freshly grated coconut and real panela. The difference is noticeable

✓ **Cultural Significance:** A living tradition maintained by Afro Colombian communities, particularly Palenquera women from San Basilio de Palenque

✓ **Accessibility:** Sold throughout the Portal de los Dulces and by vendors throughout the city. Typically $0.25 to $1 per piece

✓ **Value:** An assortment of cocadas costs just a few dollars and makes a perfect gift to bring home

**Where We Loved It Most:** The family run stands in the Portal de los Dulces (where recipes have been passed down for generations), the Palenquera vendors in colorful dress throughout the Walled City, and the Festival de los Dulces when the plaza transforms into a candy carnival.

**Verdict:** The Portal de los Dulces is a time capsule of Caribbean candy culture. Walking through the arcade, sampling cocadas from different vendors, watching the display cases full of colorful treats — it is a sweet tooth's paradise. Try the cocada with guava for a fruity version, or the one with arequipe for pure caramel indulgence. Buy a box to take home. These simple coconut candies represent centuries of Afro Colombian tradition and taste like history.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Food in Cartagena

**1. What is the single best food to eat in Cartagena?**
Cazuela de mariscos is the definitive Cartagena food experience. Scored 95.2/100 in our evaluation, it is the city's most iconic dish and the perfect representation of Caribbean Colombian cuisine — fresh seafood swimming in a rich coconut milk broth. Every visitor should try it at a traditional restaurant.

**2. Is Cartagena street food safe to eat?**
Yes. Cartagena street food culture is deeply established and generally safe. Stick to busy stalls with high turnover — this ensures fresh oil and freshly cooked food. The arepa de huevo, empanadas, and carimañolas are all widely consumed by locals daily. Watch for lines of locals as a sign of quality and freshness.

**3. How much does a meal in Cartagena cost?**
Cartagena is moderately priced by international standards but more expensive than much of Colombia. An arepa de huevo costs $1 to $2, a full plate of fried fish with sides runs $8 to $15, ceviche is typically $8 to $18, and a cazuela de mariscos ranges from $12 to $30 depending on the restaurant. A full day of excellent eating can cost as little as $25 to $40.

**4. What makes Cartagena cuisine different from other Colombian food?**
Cartagena cuisine is distinctly Caribbean, heavily influenced by African cooking traditions brought by enslaved peoples, the abundant seafood of the coast, and the widespread use of coconut in everything from rice to stews to desserts. It is sweeter, more seafood focused, and uses different spices than the highland cuisines of Bogotá or Medellín.

**5. Where is the best ceviche in Cartagena?**
La Cevichería in Plaza de San Diego remains the most famous after Anthony Bourdain's visit, and it still delivers excellent quality. Buena Vida Marisquería offers more creative presentations. For a casual experience, try the ceviche from beach vendors at Playa Blanca or Bocagrande.

**6. What time do Cartagena restaurants serve lunch and dinner?**
Lunch typically runs from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM and dinner service starts around 7:00 PM and runs until 10:00 PM or later. Many traditional restaurants close between lunch and dinner. Street food vendors often operate from early morning through late night. Arriving early or late can help avoid crowds at popular spots.

**7. Is it worth taking a food tour in Cartagena?**
Absolutely, especially for first time visitors. A guided food tour through Getsemaní or the Walled City covers multiple dishes in one outing with local context and access to places you might not find on your own. Budget roughly $50 to $80 per person for a quality tour.

**8. What is titoté and why does it matter?**
Titoté is the caramelized coconut solids that form when coconut milk is cooked down until the water evaporates. It gives arroz con coco its signature golden brown color, sweet nutty flavor, and distinguishes authentic Cartagena coconut rice from versions made elsewhere. Ask for rice "con titoté" for the most traditional experience.

**9. What are patacones and why are they served with everything?**
Patacones are twice fried green plantain rounds — smashed flat between fries for a thick, starchy, satisfying crunch. They appear alongside nearly every dish as a vehicle for scooping up sauces and as a starchy balance to seafood and meat. They are essential to the Caribbean Colombian meal.

**10. Can I eat well in Cartagena on a budget?**
Cartagena offers excellent budget eating options. An arepa de huevo for $1.50, a plate of fried fish for $10, a shrimp cocktail for $5, cocadas for under $1 — you can eat extraordinarily well for under $25 a day by sticking to street food and traditional restaurants outside the tourist center. The Bazurto Market offers particularly good value.
