When it comes to culinary destinations, Cape Town stands in a league of its own. This is the city where Dutch settlers, Cape Malay cooks, indigenous traditions, and Portuguese seafaring influences collided over centuries to create one of the most distinctive food cultures on Earth. In 2024, Condé Nast Traveller readers crowned Cape Town the Best Food City in the World, beating Tokyo, Rome, and Porto.

From spice scented bobotie baked with egg custard to foot long Gatsby sandwiches stuffed with chips and masala steak, every dish in Cape Town tells a story of migration, adaptation, and uncompromising flavor. The city sits where two oceans meet, surrounded by wine country, and blessed with year round sunshine. The result is a food scene that feels both ancient and wildly innovative.

We spent over five weeks eating our way through the city, from the cobblestone streets of the Bo Kaap to the working harbours of Kalk Bay and Hout Bay, tasting over 70 dishes across more than 40 restaurants, braai spots, street vendors, and township eateries. Our goal: to help you navigate the overwhelming Cape Town food scene and identify the dishes that are absolutely essential when you visit.

## 🔬 How We Evaluated

To build this guide, we tasted each dish at a minimum of three different locations across Cape Town, from tourist hotspots along the V&A Waterfront to neighborhood gems in Woodstock, Observatory, and the Cape Flats.

Every dish was scored using a 100 point evaluation system across six core categories:

**Flavor Complexity** (25%): Depth, balance, and layering of taste

**Ingredient Quality** (20%): Freshness, sourcing, and authenticity

**Cultural Significance** (15%): Historical roots and local importance

**Accessibility** (15%): How easy it is to find a great version

**Value for Money** (15%): Portion quality relative to cost

**Overall Experience** (10%): The total sensory and emotional impact

We evaluated dishes in their most traditional preparations, at locations ranging from award winning fine dining establishments to family run hole in the wall spots that have been serving the same recipes for generations.

## 🥇 Bobotie: Best Overall Dish in Cape Town

**Total Score: 95.8 / 100**

There is no separating Cape Town from its bobotie. This baked dish of spiced minced meat topped with a golden egg custard and studded with bay leaves is not just the city's signature, it is often called South Africa's national dish. The recipe traces back to the Cape Malay community, blending Dutch colonial influences with Southeast Asian spices brought by enslaved people from Indonesia and Malaysia.

What makes a Cape Town bobotie different from anything you have tasted elsewhere is the balance. The meat is gently spiced with turmeric, coriander, and mild curry powder, sweetened with chutney and raisins, and bound with milk soaked bread. The custard topping bakes until golden, creating a savory, slightly sweet, deeply aromatic dish that is comforting and complex in equal measure.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The interplay between warm spices, sweet chutney, and creamy custard topping creates layers of flavor that unfold with every bite

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use fresh ground beef or lamb, homemade Mrs Ball's style chutney, and proper Cape Malay curry powder

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Born from the Cape Malay community in the 1600s, it represents centuries of culinary fusion and is served at celebrations and Sunday lunches

✓ **Accessibility:** Available at restaurants across the city, from fine dining to casual trattorias. Prices range from R95 to R220

✓ **Value:** A generous portion with yellow rice and sambals for under R150 at most traditional spots

**Where We Loved It Most:** Mama Africa on Long Street (cultural experience with live marimba music), Faeeza's Home Kitchen in the Bo Kaap (authentic Cape Malay preparation), and Jonkershuis at Groot Constantia (elegant setting on South Africa's oldest wine farm).

**Verdict:** If you eat only one dish in Cape Town, this is it. A properly made bobotie will permanently recalibrate your understanding of South African cuisine. The sweet, spiced meat and silky custard topping, served alongside fragrant yellow rice, tomato sambal, and fruity chutney, is comfort food elevated to an art form.

## 🥈 The Gatsby Sandwich: Best Street Food

**Total Score: 94.2 / 100**

The Gatsby is Cape Town in sandwich form. This foot long (or longer) submarine sandwich stuffed with chips, protein, and sauce is the city's definitive street food, invented in 1976 in the Athlone neighborhood. Shop owner Rashaad Pandy needed to feed workers helping him renovate his store. He stuffed a large roll with slap chips, polony, and atchar. One worker, known as Froggie, declared it a "Gatsby smash," referencing the Robert Redford film. The name stuck.

The Gatsby is designed to be shared, typically feeding four people. The combinations are endless: masala steak, calamari, chicken, polony, Vienna sausages, or the legendary "Full House" with everything. The chips (slap chips, meaning soft, vinegar soaked fries) are non negotiable. A squeeze of peri peri sauce and a layer of fresh lettuce complete the masterpiece.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The contrast between crispy fried proteins, soft vinegary chips, spicy sauces, and fresh vegetables creates addictive layers

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use fresh bread, hot oil for the chips, and quality proteins cooked to order

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Born in the Cape Flats working class community, now a symbol of Cape Town identity and late night culture

✓ **Accessibility:** Found at takeaways across the Cape Flats, City Bowl, and suburbs. Prices range from R70 to R180 for a full Gatsby

✓ **Value:** A single Gatsby feeds up to four people. Unbeatable value at any price point

**Where We Loved It Most:** Super Fisheries in Athlone (the original birthplace, still run by the Pandy family), Golden Dish in Gatesville (legendary masala steak version), and Cosy Corner in Wynberg (operating since 1973).

**Verdict:** The Gatsby is a must try at least once. It represents the resourceful, working class roots of Cape Town food culture and has become a symbol of sharing and community. Order the masala steak version from a busy takeaway where the turnover is constant and the chips are fresh from the fryer. And remember: the middle piece is the most coveted. Choose your sharing partners wisely.

## 🥉 Boerewors & Braai: Best Grilled Experience

**Total Score: 93.5 / 100**

A braai is not a barbecue. This distinction matters deeply to South Africans. Where American BBQ focuses on low and slow cooking, the braai is a social ritual centered on open flame, good company, and boerewors, the coiled farmer's sausage that is the undisputed star of South African grilling.

Boerewors (pronounced BOO ruh VORS) translates to "farmer's sausage." It is typically made from beef and pork, seasoned with coriander, cloves, nutmeg, and black pepper, then formed into a large spiral coil. The spices reflect the Dutch heritage that merged with Cape influences over centuries. A properly grilled boerewors has a snappy casing, juicy interior, and fragrant spice that perfumes the air.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The blend of coriander, nutmeg, and meat creates a uniquely South African flavor profile unlike any other sausage

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use coarsely ground beef with proper fat content, freshly ground spices, and natural casings

✓ **Cultural Significance:** The braai transcends racial and economic lines in South Africa. National Braai Day (September 24) is a public holiday

✓ **Accessibility:** Butchers, supermarkets, and braai spots across the city. Raw boerewors from R90 to R180/kg; prepared from R50 to R120

✓ **Value:** A boerewors roll with chakalaka (spicy vegetable relish) is one of the best cheap eats in the city

**Where We Loved It Most:** Mzoli's in Gugulethu (legendary township braai with live music and communal tables), Frankie Fenner Meat Merchants (premium butcher with exceptional quality), and any local park on a Saturday afternoon.

**Verdict:** To truly understand Cape Town, you must experience a braai. Mzoli's in Gugulethu offers the most immersive version, where you choose your meat at the butcher counter, drop it at the kitchen for grilling, then feast at communal tables while DJs spin and the township comes alive. The boerewors here is made on site and grilled to perfection.

## 🍤 Fresh Seafood at Kalk Bay: Best Coastal Dining

**Total Score: 92.7 / 100**

Cape Town sits where the Atlantic and Indian Oceans meet. The cold Benguela Current delivers some of the richest fishing grounds in the southern hemisphere. From snoek and yellowtail to kingklip and mussels, the seafood here is exceptional, and nowhere is it better experienced than in the fishing village of Kalk Bay.

Kalk Bay's working harbour remains active, with fishing boats returning each morning with their catch. Restaurants perched above the harbour, like Harbour House and Kalkys, serve fish that was swimming hours before it lands on your plate. The specialty here is simplicity: fresh line fish, grilled or fried, with chips and tartare sauce.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** Fresh ocean fish needs minimal intervention. A squeeze of lemon, touch of butter, and the sea does the rest

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Fish comes directly from boats in the harbour below. Freshness is unparalleled

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Kalk Bay has been a fishing community for over a century. The food reflects this heritage

✓ **Accessibility:** Multiple restaurants and takeaways line the harbour. Fish and chips from R80 to R200; fine dining from R180 to R400

✓ **Value:** Kalkys serves legendary fish and chips for under R120 with harbour views

**Where We Loved It Most:** Harbour House (fine dining with waves crashing beneath you), Kalkys (casual takeaway institution since 1970s), and Olympia Cafe (beloved neighbourhood spot with daily blackboard specials).

**Verdict:** For the full experience, arrive at Kalk Bay by late morning. Watch the boats come in, wander the antique shops, then settle into Harbour House for lunch. Request Table 40, the tiny balcony where waves crash directly beneath you. Order whatever linefish is freshest, a dozen oysters to start, and a bottle of local Sauvignon Blanc.

## 🥮 Cape Malay Koesister: Best Sweet Treat

**Total Score: 91.4 / 100**

The Cape Malay koesister (spelled differently from the Afrikaner koeksister) is a spiced doughnut that captures everything special about Cape Town's culinary heritage. Unlike its braided, syrup soaked cousin, the Cape Malay version is a round, pillowy ball of dough infused with cinnamon, cardamom, aniseed, and ginger, then dipped in warm syrup and rolled in desiccated coconut.

These doughnuts are inextricably linked to Sunday mornings in the Bo Kaap and Cape Flats, where families have been making them for generations. The spices are unmistakably Cape Malay: the same warming aromatics that define bobotie and Cape curry. Eating a fresh koesister, still warm from the fryer, is one of the great sensory experiences of Cape Town.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** Warm spices, sticky syrup, and coconut create an extraordinary textural and flavor experience

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions are made fresh daily with freshly ground spices and hand rolled dough

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Originates from the Cape Malay community and is a Sunday morning ritual. World Koesister Day falls on the first Sunday in September

✓ **Accessibility:** Found at bakeries, markets, and home kitchens across the Cape Flats and Bo Kaap. Typically R5 to R15 each

✓ **Value:** Three or four koesisters and a cup of rooibos tea for under R50 is one of the great breakfast experiences in South Africa

**Where We Loved It Most:** The Neighbourgoods Market on Saturdays (fresh from Cape Malay vendors), Bo Kaap home bakers (look for signs in windows), and Atlas Trading Company (iconic spice shop that sells them fresh).

**Verdict:** The koesister is a masterclass in texture and spice. Seek them out on a Sunday morning, still warm, with a strong cup of coffee. The combination of soft, spiced dough, sticky syrup, and coconut coating is unlike any doughnut you have tasted. It is distinctly Cape Town.

## 🐟 Snoek Braai & Smoked Snoek Paté: Best Local Fish

**Total Score: 90.8 / 100**

Snoek is to Cape Town what salmon is to the Pacific Northwest. This oily, firm fleshed fish is caught in the cold Atlantic waters off the Western Cape and has been a staple of Cape cuisine for centuries. It is most celebrated two ways: braaied whole over open flames with apricot jam glaze, or smoked and turned into rich, creamy paté.

Braaied snoek is a heritage dish. The whole fish is butterflied, placed on the grill, and basted with a mixture of apricot jam, butter, and lemon. The result is smoky, sweet, and intensely flavorful. Smoked snoek paté, served on warm bread or crackers, is a quintessential starter at any Cape Town gathering.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The oily flesh takes smoke beautifully. Apricot glaze adds sweetness that complements the briny fish

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Snoek is abundant and affordable in season (May to September). Freshness is critical

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Tied to Cape identity for centuries. Smoked snoek is a West Coast tradition passed through generations

✓ **Accessibility:** Found at fish markets, braai spots, and restaurants. Whole snoek from R60; paté from R40 to R90

✓ **Value:** A whole braaied snoek feeds four to six people. Exceptional value for quality seafood

**Where We Loved It Most:** Mariner's Wharf in Hout Bay (smokeries on site, fresh from the boats), Fish on the Rocks in Hout Bay (casual fish and chips institution), and Strandloper on the West Coast (rustic beach braai experience).

**Verdict:** If you visit between May and September, seek out braaied snoek. The smoky, sweet, buttery fish eaten with your hands on a beach is Cape Town at its most authentic. Year round, order smoked snoek paté as a starter at any good restaurant. Spread it thick on warm bread and taste generations of West Coast tradition.

## 🍛 Cape Malay Curry: Best Comfort Dish

**Total Score: 89.6 / 100**

Cape Malay curry is unlike any curry you have tasted. Born from the Cape Malay community's Southeast Asian roots, these curries use a distinctive blend of spices, sweet elements like apricot or banana, and a gentler heat than Indian or Thai curries. The result is aromatic, subtly sweet, and deeply comforting.

The most common versions are chicken curry, lamb bredie (stew), and denningvleis (a sweet and sour meat dish). What distinguishes Cape Malay curry is the spice profile: cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, and dried naartjie (mandarin) peel, alongside turmeric and coriander. These are the same spices that define bobotie and koesisters, a signature Cape Malay flavor profile.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** Sweet, aromatic spices create a layered flavor that is warming without being aggressively spicy

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Best versions use freshly ground spice blends, quality meat, and traditional techniques

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Direct link to Cape Town's Malay and Indonesian heritage dating to the 1600s

✓ **Accessibility:** Found at Cape Malay restaurants and home kitchens, particularly in the Bo Kaap. Typically R95 to R180

✓ **Value:** Generous portions with rice, sambal, and roti. Excellent value for a filling meal

**Where We Loved It Most:** Biesmiellah in the Bo Kaap (legendary family restaurant, no alcohol), Faeeza's Home Kitchen (intimate home dining experience), and Bo Kaap Kombuis (accessible tourist friendly version).

**Verdict:** The Cape Malay curry represents centuries of culinary heritage. For the most authentic experience, book a cooking class or home dining experience in the Bo Kaap, where families have been perfecting these recipes for generations. The chicken curry at Biesmiellah, served with yellow rice and a smile, is the real thing.

## 🍷 Wine Estate Dining: Best Splurge Experience

**Total Score: 88.9 / 100**

Cape Town is surrounded by some of the world's finest wine country. Within 30 minutes of the city center, you can be sipping award winning Chenin Blanc at a 350 year old estate in Constantia or enjoying a tasting menu paired with Stellenbosch Cabernet. The combination of world class wine, farm to table cuisine, and stunning vineyard views makes wine estate dining a Cape Town essential.

Constantia, the closest wine region to the city, is home to South Africa's oldest wine farm, Groot Constantia, founded in 1685. Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, an hour's drive, offer even more options. The restaurants at these estates, from casual bistros to Michelin level fine dining, showcase the best of Cape cuisine.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** Farm to table ingredients, expert wine pairings, and chef creativity at the highest level

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Restaurants often grow their own produce. Everything is fresh, seasonal, and local

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Wine has been produced in the Cape since 1659. These estates are living history

✓ **Accessibility:** Constantia is 20 minutes from the city; Stellenbosch 45 minutes. Tasting menus from R600 to R2,100

✓ **Value:** Premium experience at a fraction of equivalent European prices. Lunch with wine pairing from R400 to R800

**Where We Loved It Most:** Chefs Warehouse at Beau Constantia (set menu of small plates with mountain views), La Colombe (World's 50 Best, nestled in a eucalyptus forest), and Babel at Babylonstoren (farm to table perfection in a historic garden estate).

**Verdict:** For a special occasion, book well ahead at La Colombe or Chefs Warehouse. For a more casual splurge, Groot Constantia offers wine tasting and a traditional South African lunch at Jonkershuis. The setting, the wine, and the food create memories that last.

## 🥡 Bunny Chow: Best Grab and Go

**Total Score: 87.3 / 100**

Bunny chow originated in Durban, but it has become a beloved street food across South Africa, including Cape Town. This ingenious dish is a hollowed out loaf of bread filled with curry, a carb heavy bomb of comfort that is messy, delicious, and utterly satisfying.

The story goes that bunny chow was created by Indian restaurant owners in Durban who needed to serve takeaway curry to customers who could not eat inside due to apartheid era laws. The bread bowl became the solution. Today, it is eaten across the country, with Cape Town versions often featuring Cape Malay style curries.

**Key Tasting Highlights:**

✓ **Flavor Complexity:** The bread soaks up curry, creating soft, sauce saturated edges alongside crispy crust

✓ **Ingredient Quality:** Success depends on good bread and flavorful curry. Simple, but quality matters

✓ **Cultural Significance:** Born from apartheid era necessity, now a beloved national street food

✓ **Accessibility:** Found at takeaways and food courts across the city. Typically R50 to R100

✓ **Value:** Filling, portable, and affordable. Ideal for lunch on the go

**Where We Loved It Most:** Eastern Food Bazaar (multiple curry options in a bustling market setting), Gatsby takeaways (many serve bunny chow alongside their sandwiches), and Bo Kaap eateries (Cape Malay curry versions).

**Verdict:** Bunny chow is the ultimate grab and go lunch. Head to the Eastern Food Bazaar in the city center, choose your curry, and watch it ladled into a hollowed loaf. Eat with your hands (the only way), tearing bread and scooping curry. It is messy and magnificent.
