When it comes to culinary destinations, Naples stands in a league of its own. This is the city that gave the world pizza, transformed the humble tomato into a culinary icon, and turned street food into high art — all while staying fiercely rooted in tradition.

We spent over four weeks eating our way through the city — from the narrow alleys of the Quartieri Spagnoli to the seaside trattorias of Mergellina — tasting over 60 dishes across more than 30 restaurants, pizzerias, bakeries, and street carts.

## How We Evaluated

Every dish was scored using a 100-point system across six categories: flavor complexity (25%), ingredient quality (20%), cultural significance (15%), accessibility (15%), value for money (15%), and overall experience (10%).

We evaluated dishes at a minimum of three different locations — from Michelin-recognised spots to family-run holes-in-the-wall that have been serving the same recipes for generations.

## 🥇 Pizza Margherita — Best Overall

<div class="score-badge">96.4 / 100</div>

There is no separating Naples from its pizza. The Margherita — San Marzano tomatoes, fior di latte or buffalo mozzarella, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil on a blistered, wood-fired crust — is not just the city's signature dish. It is a UNESCO-recognised cultural treasure.

What makes a Neapolitan Margherita different from every other pizza on the planet is the oven. Traditional pizzerias fire at over 450°C, cooking the pie in roughly 60 to 90 seconds. The result: a crust that is charred and pillowy at the edges, soft and almost soupy in the centre.

**Where to eat it:** L'Antica Pizzeria da Michele (since 1870, only Margherita and Marinara on the menu), 50 Kalò in Mergellina, Diego Vitagliano Pizzeria in Bagnoli.

<div class="verdict-box">
**Verdict:** If you eat only one thing in Naples, this is it. The Margherita here will permanently recalibrate your understanding of pizza. This is ground zero — and it shows.

## 🥈 Sfogliatella — Best Pastry

<div class="score-badge">93.1 / 100</div>

Naples runs on espresso and sfogliatelle. This iconic pastry comes in two forms: the *riccia* (flaky, shell-shaped, crisp layered dough) and the *frolla* (smooth shortcrust, rounder shape). Both are filled with a warm semolina and ricotta cream scented with citrus and cinnamon.

The riccia is the showstopper. Biting through the shattering layers of dough into the sweet, slightly grainy ricotta filling is one of the great sensory experiences in European pastry.

**Where to eat it:** Pasticceria Attanasio near Stazione Centrale, Gran Caffè Gambrinus on Piazza del Plebiscito.

<div class="verdict-box">
**Verdict:** The sfogliatella riccia is a masterclass in texture. Pair it with a strong Neapolitan espresso at a standing bar for the full local experience. The frolla is excellent too — but the riccia is what you came for.

## 🥉 Ragù Napoletano — Best Slow-Cooked Dish

<div class="score-badge">91.8 / 100</div>

Neapolitan ragù is nothing like its Bolognese cousin. This is a Sunday sauce — a deep, dark, intensely flavoured tomato and meat preparation that simmers for anywhere from four to eight hours. Large cuts of beef, pork ribs, and sometimes sausage slow-cook in the sauce until they practically dissolve.

The sauce is served over wide pasta like paccheri or rigatoni, while the tender braised meats become a separate second course. Two meals in one.

**Where to eat it:** Tandem Ragù (an entire restaurant dedicated to ragù in the centro storico), Osteria della Mattonella in the Quartieri Spagnoli.

<div class="verdict-box">
**Verdict:** The depth of flavour in a properly made Neapolitan ragù is staggering. It's comfort food elevated to an art form. If you visit on a Sunday, finding a trattoria serving their house ragù should be your mission.

## Pasta e Patate con Provola — Best Comfort Dish

<div class="score-badge">89.5 / 100</div>

This dish is Neapolitan *cucina povera* — poor man's cooking — at its absolute finest. A thick, starchy soup of pasta and potatoes, finished with stretchy smoked provola cheese that melts into silky threads throughout. On paper it sounds impossibly simple. In practice it delivers a richness that rivals dishes with ten times the ingredients.

**Where to eat it:** Trattoria Da Nennella in the Quartieri Spagnoli (loud, chaotic, utterly authentic), Osteria Pignatelli.

<div class="verdict-box">
**Verdict:** Don't overlook this dish because the ingredients sound basic. A cold-weather essential and one of those rare dishes where the whole is infinitely greater than the sum of its parts.
</div>

## Cuoppo Fritto — Best Street Food

<div class="score-badge">88.7 / 100</div>

The cuoppo is Naples in a paper cone. A mix of lightly fried seafood — calamari, shrimp, small fish — served piping hot from street-side fryers. The batter is thin and crisp, letting the freshness of the seafood come through in every bite. There's also a *terra* version filled with fried potato croquettes, arancini, and frittatine di pasta.

**Where to eat it:** Friggitoria Vomero, the street carts along Via Pignasecca, Casa Capasso on Via dei Tribunali.

<div class="verdict-box">
**Verdict:** The ultimate walk-and-eat snack. Grab one from a busy stall where the oil is fresh and the turnover is constant. A squeeze of lemon on top is non-negotiable.
</div>

## Babà al Rum — Best Dessert

<div class="score-badge">87.3 / 100</div>

A small, mushroom-shaped sponge cake soaked in rum syrup until it is impossibly moist, fragrant, and boozy. Originally borrowed from French and Polish baking traditions, the babà has been fully adopted by Naples and refined into something entirely its own. A perfectly made babà should be spongy but never soggy, with a rum kick that is present but balanced.

**Where to eat it:** Pasticceria Scaturchio on Piazza San Domenico Maggiore, Gran Caffè Gambrinus.

<div class="verdict-box">
**Verdict:** A well-executed babà is a transcendent dessert experience. The rum fragrance alone is worth the visit. Just make sure the sponge is fresh — a dry babà is a tragedy, and a soaked one is a revelation.
